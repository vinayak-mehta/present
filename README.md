`present` is built on [asciimatics](https://github.com/peterbrittain/asciimatics), and it works with `Python>=3.7`.

Check out the [gallery](https://present.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery/index.html) to see what everyone is making with `present`! You can add your slides by simply [opening an issue](https://github.com/vinayak-mehta/present/issues/new?assignees=&labels=made-with-present&template=submit-slides-to-gallery.md&title=Add+slides+to+gallery).

## Installation

You can simply use pip to install `present`:

```bash
$ pip install present
```

## Usage

```bash
$ present sample.md
```

Some controls:

- Quit: `q`
- Previous slide: `b`, Left arrow, Page Up
- Next slide: `n`, Space bar, Right arrow, Page Down

At the end, you can press `r` to restart the presentation.

## Syntax

Slides follow [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) syntax. You can check out the [sample slides](https://github.com/vinayak-mehta/present/blob/master/examples/sample.md) for reference.

**Note:** Some things aren't supported yet:
- Effects and colors on the same slide.
- Effects and code on the same slide.

### Separator

Each slide can be separated with a `---`.

```
Slide 1

---

Slide 2
```

### Headers

Level 1 headings become figlets, level 2 headings get underlined with `-`, and level 3 headings become bold.

```
# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3
```

### Text

```
This is normal text

This is **bold text**

This is `inline code`

As Kanye West said:

> We're living the future so
> the present is our past.
```

### Lists

Ordered lists become unordered lists automatically.

```
- Item 1
    - Item 1a
    - Item 1b
    - Item 1c
- Item 2
    - Item 2a
```

### Images

Image paths are relative to the directory where your slides are kept, and where you invoke `present`.

```
![RC](images/recurse.png)
```

Note: You can use high resolution images and tweak the terminal font size to get the best results.

### Code blocks

To specify your language for syntax highlighting, put it on the first line after the backticks. If no language is specified, no highlighting will be applied.

<pre>
```python
import os

os.getcwd()
```
</pre>

### Codios

Codios are pre-recorded playable code blocks which can be useful for live demos. You can find out how to write one in the [codio](https://present.readthedocs.io/en/latest/codio.html) section of the documentation.

```
![codio](codio.yml)
```

### Style

Each slide can be styled with foreground / background colors and effects. By default, slides are black on white with no effects. You can add style to a slide by adding a comment at the beginning of the slide (after the slide separator):

```
Slide 1

---
<!-- fg=black bg=yellow -->

Slide 2

---
<!-- effect=explosions -->

Slide 3
```

Colors: `black`, `red`, `green`, `yellow`, `blue`, `magenta`, `cyan`, `white`.

Effects: `fireworks`, `explosions`, `stars`, `matrix`, `plasma`. More coming soon!
